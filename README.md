# odin-recipes

This project is meant to demonstrate basic HTML skills, such as:

- creating pages
- linking them together to form a website
- working with the text, separating it into paragraphs, basic formatting skills etc.
- working with images

Ideally, this should become a somewhat usable website containing recipes.
